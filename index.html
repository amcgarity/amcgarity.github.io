    <p>The Eagles are have the best record in the NFL because they have ... </p>
    <ul> 
       <li>a tremendous new quarterback</li>
       <li>the best run defense in the league</li>
       <li>a terrific coaching staff</li>
       <li>a new and improving cadre of wide receivers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Eagles have won several NFC East Divisional Championships during the past few decades. On January 21, 2018, they defeated the Minnesota Vikings to win their third NFC Championship resulting in a third trip to the Super Bowl on February 4, 2018.  Unfortunately, they lost both of their previous Super Bowl games, once to the Oakland Raiders, and once to the New England Patriots.  But the 2017-18 season promises to be the Eagle's best season ever when the Eagles win their Super Bowl rematch with the Patriots.</p>
