    <p>The Eagles are have the best record in the NFL because they have ... </p>
    <ul> 
       <li>a tremendous new quarterback <em style="color:red;">(click on the Eagles Logo above)</em></li>
       <li>the best run defense in the league</li>
       <li>a terrific coaching staff</li>
       <li>a new and improving cadre of wide receivers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Eagles have won several NFC East Divisional Championships during the past few decades, but only two NFC Championships since 1980, resulting in just two visits to the Super Bowl.  Unfortunately, they lost both of their Super Bowl games, once to the Oakland Raiders, and once to the New England Patriots.  The 2017-18 season promises to be the Eagle's best season in many years and may lead to their first Super Bowl victory.</p>
